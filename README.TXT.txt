This project is a very simple task manager that can be closed and save all tasks that are added, removed, or edited in the form. I was able to get the basics of what makes a good task manager, however, I was not able to get to the audio or notification selection for tasks, so for now, the project is only a visual task manager where you will have to see what tasks you have and won't be reminded of them. I was also going to do a settings form that would give settings for the user to change, but since I did not make the notification and audio reminders, there was very little that would be in settings so I decided to just remove it. The code SHOULD work without changing the savefile file location variable on each form's code, however, if it does not work, then please change the saveFile variable string to wherever the saveFile.txt has been saved.
